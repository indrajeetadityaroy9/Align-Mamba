# Ablation: No Cross-Attention (Pure Mamba Decoder)
# Paper Reference: Table 2
#
# Decoder with NO HYBRID blocks - pure Mamba throughout.
# Tests whether cross-attention is necessary for translation quality.
# Expected: Poor translation quality (no explicit source alignment).
#
# HYBRID positions: [] (empty - no cross-attention)
