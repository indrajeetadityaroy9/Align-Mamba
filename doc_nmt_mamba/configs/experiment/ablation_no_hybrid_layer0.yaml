# Ablation: No HYBRID at Layer 0 (Blind Start Proof)
# Paper Reference: Table 2
#
# This proves the "Blind Start" problem: without HYBRID at layer 0,
# cross-attention has no positional context for queries.
# Expected: Significant performance degradation.
#
# HYBRID positions: [8, 16] instead of [0, 8, 16]
